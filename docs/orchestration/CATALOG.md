# Orchestration router

This is a pointer-only active-tree router. It contains no scientific evidence or authorization.

## Current work

- Live snapshot: [`LIVE-STATE.md`](LIVE-STATE.md); run its freshness check before use.
- Bounded queue: [`../CURRENT_WORK.md`](../CURRENT_WORK.md); sources live in
  [`control-plane/`](control-plane/).
- Queue overflow: [`../CURRENT_WORK_OVERFLOW.md`](../CURRENT_WORK_OVERFLOW.md).
- Unpromoted active records: [`../CURRENT_WORK_BACKLOG.md`](../CURRENT_WORK_BACKLOG.md).
- Active process rules: [`PLAYBOOK.md`](PLAYBOOK.md).
- Open/deferred source records: [`../OPEN_ITEMS.md`](../OPEN_ITEMS.md).
- Joseph-only decisions: [`USER-DECISIONS.md`](USER-DECISIONS.md).

## Evidence and claims

- Verified numbers: [`../../VALIDATION_LEDGER.md`](../../VALIDATION_LEDGER.md).
- Physics claims: [`CLAIMS.md`](CLAIMS.md).
- Active BEN identifiers: [`FINDINGS.md`](FINDINGS.md); full evidence is at the frozen tag.
- Bugs and traps: [`../../KNOWN_ISSUES.md`](../../KNOWN_ISSUES.md).
- Retracted values: [`INDEX-retracted-and-superseded-values.md`](INDEX-retracted-and-superseded-values.md).

### Documents that open items route to but this router did not list

Added 2026-08-20. `live_doc_indexed.py --check` reports **19 LIVE docs absent from this
catalog and does NOT enforce it**, so an item's own governing document could be
unreachable from the router. These five are the subset that `docs/OPEN_ITEMS.md` rows
actually cite; the other fourteen are not routed to by any open item and are left out
deliberately, because this file is a pointer-only router and not an exhaustive index.

- [`PROVENANCE-DEBT-20260810-standard-p4.md`](PROVENANCE-DEBT-20260810-standard-p4.md) — **`OI-7`'s
  own blocker**: its §3e is the sentence that row is open on. Cited 4× in `OPEN_ITEMS.md` and
  reachable from no router until now.
- [`SPEC-20260814-gate5-cstat-construction-v1.md`](SPEC-20260814-gate5-cstat-construction-v1.md) —
  the ruled `C_stat` construction spec; cited 6×, including by `OI-93`, whose row is stale against
  it.
- [`RANK-AND-INVERSION-20260810.md`](RANK-AND-INVERSION-20260810.md) — the rank and pseudo-inverse
  measurements behind the N-D χ² protocol; routed to by `OI-137`.
- [`RECONCILIATION-20260817-gbdtfive-macros-vs-rebuilt-candidate.md`](RECONCILIATION-20260817-gbdtfive-macros-vs-rebuilt-candidate.md)
  — traces the `\gbdtFive*` note macros to their artifacts; one of them had been destroyed.
- [`DETERMINATION-20260811-cause5-binding-half.md`](DETERMINATION-20260811-cause5-binding-half.md),
  [`CONVENTION-verifying-a-check-is-deployed.md`](CONVENTION-verifying-a-check-is-deployed.md) —
  each cited once.

## Task routes

| Task | Route |
|---|---|
| Change code | `KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, relevant status/reference, callers, tests, and hash bindings |
| Quote a result | `VALIDATION_LEDGER.md`, then the exact product or live receipt |
| Run or monitor compute | fresh `LIVE-STATE.md`, direct scheduler observation, then the exact launcher receipt |
| Work on 2D/3D/N-D/PET | relevant workstream status; PET also `PET_UQ_REMEDIATION_STATUS.md` |
| Maintain queue/playbook | [`control-plane/policy.json`](control-plane/policy.json), [`control-plane/source-record-inventory.tsv`](control-plane/source-record-inventory.tsv), then `control_plane_lint.py` |
| Maintain classifications | `MANIFEST-overrides.tsv`, then `generate_manifest.py` |
| Operate continuation | `WAKER.md`, `wakerctl.py`, `waker-config.json`, and `profiles.json` |
| Build deliverables | `docs/analysis-note/build_all.sh` for note, primer, and paper |

## Frozen pre-compaction evidence

Complete history, terminal receipts, long-form findings, audits, determinations, prompts, and old paths
live at:

`evidence/prepublication-2026-08-20-0b329e8a`

Recover a known path without changing the current checkout:

```bash
git show evidence/prepublication-2026-08-20-0b329e8a:<old-path>
```

Search the complete frozen tree:

```bash
git grep '<identifier>' evidence/prepublication-2026-08-20-0b329e8a --
```

The independently stored bundle and recovery proof are recorded in
[`../POST_PUBLICATION_REORG_PLAN.md`](../POST_PUBLICATION_REORG_PLAN.md).

### Anchored-but-unreachable commits — `git fetch github` will NEVER bring these down

Several commits cited in the record are reachable from **no branch**; that is exactly why they were
anchored by `evidence/*` tags. **Git only auto-follows tags that point at objects it is already
downloading**, and `remote.github.fetch` is branches-only
(`+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/github/*`) with `remote.github.tagOpt` unset — so a tag on a commit
unreachable from `refs/heads/*` can never arrive from an ordinary fetch. **Measured 2026-08-20: six
of the ten `evidence/*` tags on the remote were absent from the main checkout, and `git cat-file -t`
failed outright on all six anchored commits — including `ecee9ff1`, the one carrying
`array_equal True across all 114,361,636 elements`.** Preservation had succeeded; discovery had not,
and a session here would reasonably have concluded the evidence was lost.

Fetch them explicitly — once per checkout:

```bash
git fetch github 'refs/tags/evidence/*:refs/tags/evidence/*'
```

Or make an ordinary `git fetch github` do it permanently, per checkout:

```bash
git config --add remote.github.fetch '+refs/tags/evidence/*:refs/tags/evidence/*'
```

**The remote is `github`.** There is no remote named `origin` — `git rev-parse origin/main` is
fatal — so any witness phrased against `origin/…` is unfollowable as written.

**Test reachability with `git for-each-ref --contains <sha>`, never `git branch -a --contains`,**
which cannot see tags and will declare an anchored commit disposable.

**Resolve citations by SHA, not by path.** A path can resolve at HEAD and read a *different* file
with no error. Measured: `nd-unfolding/mii_anchor_comparator.py` is blob `a7cb2d9b…` at both
`ecee9ff1` and `f7ab02ff`, and `cbeac61d…` at HEAD.
