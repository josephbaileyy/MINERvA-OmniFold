# REPORT 2026-09-22 — review-loop residue: the termination condition was NOT met

**CITABLE FOR:** the state of this session's review loop and the findings left open.
**NOT CITABLE FOR:** a clean bill of health on anything in `3035f8b8..HEAD`. **The loop did not
terminate on its own criterion**, and this report exists because saying so is the required outcome.

## 1. The criterion, and where the loop actually stopped

The instruction was: terminate only when **(i)** two consecutive self-review rounds produce zero
findings **and (ii)** an independent `agy`-class reviewer, in its own isolated worktree, produces
zero on a round after that. Any finding by the reviewer **resets the counter to zero**.

| round | findings | note |
|---|---:|---|
| 1 (self) | **3** | stale `MANIFEST.tsv` from regenerating before staging; a wrong correction I made to another lane; my own CATALOG entry tripping my own detector |
| 2 (self) | **0** | M1–M4 re-verified against the adoption record; the 13-file PASS re-probed for removed guards; seed gate tested behaviourally |
| 3 (self) | **0** | table/pipe structure, cross-reference resolution, citation targets |
| **agy (independent)** | **14** | **counter RESET to zero** |
| 4 (self, post-agy) | 1 | a **fabricated sha** in a commit message I had already pushed |

**Condition (i) was satisfied at rounds 2–3 and then destroyed by the reviewer's 14.** Condition
(ii) has never been satisfied. Reaching it would need two further clean self-rounds **and** a
second clean independent review; this session stopped before that, so **the loop is open.**

⚠ **The most useful single fact in this report:** two consecutive clean self-rounds were worth
very little. An independent reviewer that had not seen my reasoning then found **14**, including
three with real consequences and one that broke a shipped deliverable. **Self-review converged on
my own blind spots.**

## 2. Disposition of the 14

**Repaired (10)** — each verified independently before acting, not taken on the reviewer's word:

| # | what | where fixed |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | the package's own reader recipe raised `AssertionError` (`== 0.0` is build-host-specific) | `release-package…/README.md` §5, §6 |
| 2 | the drift argument omitted an **unconditional** provenance-write block | item-2 record §3, §4 |
| 3 | the 3D figure list wrong in both directions; two `sec_3d.tex` sentences falsified | 3D record §5; `sec_3d.tex` ×3 |
| 4 | four M2/M3/M4 clauses dropped, all making the package read less adverse | package README §1 |
| 5 | VL145's *"the 19-byte difference is **entirely** the metadata strings"* | `VALIDATION_LEDGER.md` VL145 |
| 8 | my verdict ratified `MANIFEST.tsv` where the checker reads `MANIFEST-overrides.tsv` | VERDICT §2(3) |
| 9 | row census `23–62` cited against a sha where it is `23–60` | BLOCKED record §3 |
| 10 | *"26 to 42"* cited to VL145, whose own scan spans **2 to 42** | 3D record §5 |
| 13 | §4c's disposition falsified by §4d in the same commit | correction record §4c |
| — | (round 4) a fabricated monorepo sha in a pushed commit message | standalone `51794c5c` |

**Recorded, not repaired (4)** — `KNOWN_ISSUES.md` rows 63–65:

- **6 + 7 → row 63.** The PASS token carries a present-tense pointer to KNOWN_ISSUES rows that did
  not exist at its own `code_rev` (61–62 landed three commits later at `9e78a8cf`), and its
  `files_changed_in_scope: 13` counts the derived surface, not its own 23-path `review_scope`
  (measured: **14 files / 1988 insertions**, the 14th being `lib_member_resume.sh`, `A`, +230).
  **Unrepairable by construction: the token IS the sha256 of those bytes.** Neither defect changes
  the verdict — the extra file is new, so *"additive or restrictive"* survives, and the token still
  resolves `TOKEN-OK`.
- **11 → row 64.** `check_dead_containment.py` returns **exit 1** in a checkout without built PDFs
  (`docs/analysis-note/main_*.pdf` is gitignored at `.gitignore:12`) and exit 0 with
  `--source-only`. I cited it bare as *"exit 0 (RESULT :: PASS)"* — a green that cannot be mapped
  to a sha, which is row 60(1)'s own class, in the commit fixing row 60(1).
- **12 → row 65.** `state/check-withdrawal-completeness-20260910.py` already implements *"did this
  withdrawal reach every site"* — pinned inventory, unregistered-file discovery, fail-closed,
  `--self-test` exit 0 — and its docstring names **line-wrapped survivors** and **stale
  `CATALOG.md` router entries** among the four failures it exists for. **Site 10 is both.** The
  2026-09-21 withdrawal was never registered in it, and §4d published a *"ZERO live assertions"*
  standing set no committed artifact reproduces. ⚠ Its current exit 1 is **pre-existing debt**
  (two unregistered files, all three paths untouched by this range).
- **14.** *"WHY TEN SWEEPS MISSED IT"* in `5c418e82`'s message is a bare count — no enumeration
  anywhere in the tree; the identifiable sweeps number three or four. Commit messages are
  immutable; recorded here only.

## 3. What is still open, stated as work and not as risk

1. **Condition (ii) is unmet.** A second independent review has not run. The 10 repairs above are
   **unreviewed by anyone but their author.**
2. **Rows 63–65** are open by design.
3. **Item 4's comparability failure is structural** and has no repair in this toolchain: matching
   the graded members' code identity requires executing at `d64257c3`, which dies under the OI-136
   guard. See `OUTCOME-20260922-L2-sproj-measured-and-the-pair-is-not-code-comparable.md` §3a.
4. **The 3D projection's `declared-dst-cv` variant** has not been built and that declaration has
   not been made; the four marked figures stay marked.
5. **ISSUE-59** is terminal-blocked under D7, not resolved.

## 4. What did NOT move

No scientific number changed in either direction. `M1`'s `6.145388%` against the `5%` bound is
untouched; `3d7465f6…` is untouched; no covariance was adopted or replaced; no significance is
quoted; `M1`–`M4` travel unchanged with both withdrawals (`M2`'s *"a larger ensemble would not
reduce it"*, `M3`'s *"lower bound"*) intact.
