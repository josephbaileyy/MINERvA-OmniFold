# --- OI-136 / Joseph's ruling 17, 2026-08-22: TWO ROOTS, BOTH MANDATORY, NEITHER DEFAULTED -------
# This line used to read `REPO="<the canonical checkout>"` unconditionally, and every `source`, every
# `cd` and every `python3` below hung off it. That decides the EXECUTING TREE before any interpreter
# or guard starts, so no amount of Python-side work can reach it -- "the wrong root is selected
# before Python or the guard starts" (Joseph, ruling 18).
#   MNV_CODE_ROOT  the approved clean execution tree. Every `.sh` sourced and every `.py` executed or
#                  imported must resolve under it; it is immutable and `git status --porcelain`-empty
#                  for the duration of the run, at a named sha recorded in the run receipt.
#   MNV_DATA_ROOT  the working directory for inputs and products. The canonical checkout is
#                  acceptable in THIS ROLE ONLY. Nothing is executed or imported from it.
# WHY TWO AND NOT ONE: a clean checkout cannot simultaneously host ~47.7 GB of gitignored member
# products and remain clean, and `of_inputs_5d.npz` is absent from a fresh clone, so a clean tree
# cannot serve as the working directory at all.
# NO `${VAR:-<hardcode>}` DEFAULT ANYWHERE: a default is the hardcode wearing a flag, and a silently
# empty defaulted variable makes every path below name a different subject without erroring. Same
# mandatory form, and the same reason, as `pet/sbatch_gate6_leg0_tier_calibration_array.sh:64`.
# The two roots MAY name the same directory; nothing here requires them to differ.

# M(ii) OFFSET HOOK (spec (B) option (ii), BEN-461). The launcher keeps its OWN baseline
# literal, so MNV_EST_SEED_OFFSET=0 -- the default -- reproduces the archive EXACTLY and the
# two coherence groups are preserved BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by the driver getting it
# right: one offset in, each leg adds it to its own baseline. Do not replace this with an
# absolute-seed override; that hands the group structure back to the caller.
# MEMBER AXIS. THE _sb LITERALS BELOW ARE DELIBERATELY UNCHANGED. This combine reads
# block_slabs_5d_sb/ while sbatch_uthrow_block_5d.sh WRITES block_slabs_5d/ -- a real, pre-existing
# mismatch (both namespaces hold separately populated old products, 8 and 36 npz). Repointing the
# literal would change what a NON-SCAN run reads, which is archive behaviour and not mine to move.
# WHAT NAMESPACING DOES TO IT, reported as a SIDE EFFECT rather than presented as a fix: inside a
# member the block glob resolves to block_slabs_5d_sb/member_kNNNNNN/, which the block leg never
# writes, so the combine hits unified_throw_cov.py's "no block-unit slabs match" SystemExit instead
# of silently consuming ARCHIVED _sb blocks. The mismatch becomes LOUD inside a member and is
# unchanged outside one. Which namespace is intended is still an open decision.

# --- OI-136 ROUND 2, 2026-08-22: EVERY production Python invocation is GUARDED, and the record is
# --- REQUIRED. Authorized by Joseph: "every production Python invocation across the eight k=0
# --- launchers is to be routed through mnv_guarded_run.py, with a required inventory", plus the
# --- contract-required executing-file parity calls and source-manifest comparison.
#
# WHY THIS IS WORTH DOING NOW AND WAS NOT BEFORE. The contract's B-1 argued a wrapper "cannot help
# them and would block the run" -- true of the PRE-REPAIR bytes, where `import xsec_nd` resolved
# under the canonical checkout and the guard correctly exited 3. That argument EXPIRED with the
# six source repairs: post-repair these entrypoints resolve under ${MNV_CODE_ROOT}, so the wrapper
# now runs GREEN and NON-VACUOUSLY -- `checked > 0` and `repo_origin_count > 0` -- which is exactly
# the positive evidence a bare exit 0 could never be.
#
# THE INVENTORY IS ONE FILE PER PROCESS, NOT ONE PER RUN. An array of 169 tasks appending to a
# single file across nodes is a corruption risk with no upside; per-process files still give F-4
# its count (inventories == guarded processes) and `mnv_import_set_ratchet.py` reads the directory.

# SOURCED RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT, NOT THROUGH ${REPO}. A launcher frozen at a sha that sources its
# member-axis library from the MUTABLE canonical checkout is not frozen: at run time it picks up
# whatever is in /pscratch/.../MINERvA-OmniFold, which is on a divergent local main that does not
# contain this library at all. Demonstrated, not theorised -- the cluster probe failed 16/16 with
# exactly that error. Relative sourcing means a frozen deployment sources its OWN frozen library,
# and a git worktree resolves its own. The library lives beside this file, so no path arithmetic.
# The three PRE-EXISTING ${REPO} sources on the lines above have the same exposure across 244
# tracked .sh and are deliberately NOT touched here: that is a repo-wide migration, not a patch.
# --- M(ii) member axis: LOCATE lib_member_resume.sh, then source it -------------------------------
# `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` IS THE SPOOL PATH UNDER sbatch. Slurm copies the batch script to
# /var/spool/slurmd/job<N>/slurm_script and executes the COPY, so `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` is the
# spool directory and the library was never staged there. Measured, not theorised: stage 0's first three
# arrays died in 12 s at exactly this line with
#   /var/spool/slurmd/job57250483/lib_member_resume.sh: No such file or directory
# while the library sat correctly at 13,845 bytes in the frozen tree.
#
# WHY FOUR PROBE RUNS AND A GATE PASSED OVER IT. Direct execution and the argv probe (which `source`s
# launchers from a parent shell) BOTH preserve BASH_SOURCE as the real path. sbatch is the only
# invocation that stages the script, and it is the only one production uses. The go-line was verified
# twice in environments that share the property it depends on.
#
# EACH CANDIDATE IS VALIDATED BY THE LIBRARY'S PRESENCE, NOT BY TRUSTING ITS MECHANISM. That is the
# actual lesson: a resolver that assumes cannot detect the environment where its assumption is false.
#
# SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CANDIDATE. It would have worked here, but it is the SUBMIT
# directory rather than the script's, so submitting from the canonical checkout -- which also contains a
# lib_member_resume.sh -- would silently source the CANONICAL library instead of the frozen one. That
# reintroduces the exact frozen-deployment defect the relative source was written to close, and it does
# so INVISIBLY. A candidate that can resolve to the wrong tree is worse than failing closed.
