# N-D OmniFold — Run Log (append-only)

## 2026-06-03 — Workstream D kickoff: q3 4th axis + NN track

Implemented `../docs/HIGHER_DIM_OMNIFOLD_DESIGN.md` end-to-end.

**Axis-list refactor + N-D math**
- `xsec_nd.py`: N-D extraction/projection on `np.histogramdd`. Self-tests pass,
  incl. bit-equivalence-to-<1e-12 vs the frozen `3d-unfolding/xsec_3d.py` and the
  4D q3-marginal→3D Jacobian identity (max rel 3.8e-16).
- `unfold_nd_omnifold_unbinned.py`: driver parametrized over an `EXTRA_AXES`
  registry (pt,pz fixed; eavail,q3 as configurable extra axes). `--axes eavail`
  reproduces 3D; `--axes eavail,q3` is the 4D unfold. Launched an `--axes eavail`
  reproduction on the existing 3D omnifile as the refactor's validation.

**C++ q3 (event loop)**
- Added `CVUniverse::RecoQ3()` (calorimetric, `LowRecoilFunctions::GetLowRecoilQ3`
  lineage) + used MAT `Getq3True()` for truth; dumped `sim_q3/MC_q3/measured_q3/
  sim_background_q3` in `runEventLoopOmniFold.cpp` (24 q3 touchpoints, symmetric
  with the eavail schema). Verified branches `MasterAnaDev_recoil_E`, `mc_Q2`,
  `mc_primFSLepton` exist in the raw tuples.
- Built (`make -j8 runEventLoopOmniFold` + `make install`, exit 0) → fresh
  `MINERvA101/opt/bin/runEventLoopOmniFold`.
- Smoke test on one 1A file: truth MC_q3 ∈ [0.05, 85] GeV median 1.77 (clean);
  reco q3 median sane (1.5–3.8 GeV) with large calorimetric tails (max ~1e5 GeV
  on pathological recoil) that the catch-all top q3 bin absorbs, mirroring reco
  Eavail. Confirmed RecoQ3/Getq3True run without error.
- Submitted the 12-playlist re-run: **SLURM 53905768** (array 1-12) →
  `runEventLoopOmniFold_4D_${PL}.root` (CV-only). Chained: **53906839**
  (afterok) hadds → `runEventLoopOmniFold_4D_MEFHC.root`, runs the 4D CV unfold
  `xsec_4d_MEFHC_5iter_lgbm.root`, the anchors (`check_4d_anchors.py`), and the
  injected-q3 closure.

**NN / point-cloud track (Phase 2)**
- Vendored `ViniciusMikuni/omnifold` → `../omnifold_nn/` (git clone; PET + MLP,
  keras/TF — the only linked repo with a point-cloud net). Env: no TF in the ROOT
  conda env, but `module load tensorflow/2.15.0` is available (matches the repo's
  `tensorflow>=2.15` req) and GPU-capable.
- `omnifold_nn_core.py`: ROOT-free keras-MLP (from the vendored `net.py`) behind a
  sklearn fit/predict_proba with standardization + the estimator-agnostic two-step
  loop. `omnifold.py` got an `estimator="nn"` branch delegating to it (lazy TF).
- NN-vs-GBDT cross-check (same loop, same inputs, swap classifier): leg 1
  **53906721** (CPU/ROOT) dumps `of_inputs_3d.npz` + runs the GBDT leg
  (`res_lgbm_3d.npz`); leg 2 **53906748** (GPU, afterok) runs the keras-MLP leg
  (`res_nn_3d.npz`).

**First results + two bug fixes (2026-06-04)**
- Event loop (53905768) completed all 12 playlists; hadd → `runEventLoopOmniFold_4D_MEFHC.root`
  (3.4 GB, POT summed correctly).
- **GBDT npz cross-check leg validated the whole new stack**: `omnifold_loop` (the
  ROOT-free copy of the two-step loop) on the dumped 3D inputs gives total σ =
  **3.0785e-38** — exactly the frozen 3D headline. This confirms the axis-list
  readers (`nn_dump_inputs.py` uses the driver's `collect_*`), `xsec_nd.py`, and the
  loop, independently of ROOT plotting.
- **Bug 1 (fixed): THnSparseD segfault.** The 4D unfold wrote `hXSecND_flat` then
  segfaulted in the 4D `THnSparseD` Python write (C-level, so the driver's
  `try/except` could not catch it), aborting before the projections/anchors/closure.
  Dropped the THnSparse path entirely — the flat TH1D (C-order ravel) + the TH2D
  marginal + 1D projections are the canonical outputs; N-D structure is recovered by
  reshaping with the known edges. Same crash had hung the login-node 3D-repro run.
- **Bug 2 (fixed): NN normalization collapse.** The keras-MLP leg ran end-to-end on
  GPU (TF 2.15, GPU found) and recovered the correct dσ/dpt,dpz,dEavail **shape**,
  but the absolute normalization collapsed to **2.7e-44** (~1e-6 of GBDT): the MLP
  sat at the trivial class-balance bias `p=W1/(W0+W1)` and never learned the x-density
  ratio. Fix: train the NN on class-BALANCED weights (`_balance_weights`) and restore
  the true normalization via `w=(W1/W0)·p/(1-p)` (`_class_ratio`); GBDT keeps raw
  weights (it calibrates the absolute ratio directly). This is exactly the failure the
  "validate NN vs GBDT before trusting it" gate is meant to catch.
- Re-running with both fixes: 4D unfold+anchors+closure (53925395), NN leg (53925396).
  Final anchor numbers + NN/GBDT agreement to be appended.
