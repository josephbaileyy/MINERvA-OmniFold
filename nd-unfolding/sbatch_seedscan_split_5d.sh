# SOURCED RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT, NOT THROUGH ${REPO}. A launcher frozen at a sha that sources its
# member-axis library from the MUTABLE canonical checkout is not frozen: at run time it picks up
# whatever is in /pscratch/.../MINERvA-OmniFold, which is on a divergent local main that does not
# contain this library at all. Demonstrated, not theorised -- the cluster probe failed 16/16 with
# exactly that error. Relative sourcing means a frozen deployment sources its OWN frozen library,
# and a git worktree resolves its own. The library lives beside this file, so no path arithmetic.
# The three PRE-EXISTING ${REPO} sources on the lines above have the same exposure across 244
# tracked .sh and are deliberately NOT touched here: that is a repo-wide migration, not a patch.
# --- M(ii) member axis: LOCATE lib_member_resume.sh, then source it -------------------------------
# `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` IS THE SPOOL PATH UNDER sbatch. Slurm copies the batch script to
# /var/spool/slurmd/job<N>/slurm_script and executes the COPY, so `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` is the
# spool directory and the library was never staged there. Measured, not theorised: stage 0's first three
# arrays died in 12 s at exactly this line with
#   /var/spool/slurmd/job57250483/lib_member_resume.sh: No such file or directory
# while the library sat correctly at 13,845 bytes in the frozen tree.
#
# WHY FOUR PROBE RUNS AND A GATE PASSED OVER IT. Direct execution and the argv probe (which `source`s
# launchers from a parent shell) BOTH preserve BASH_SOURCE as the real path. sbatch is the only
# invocation that stages the script, and it is the only one production uses. The go-line was verified
# twice in environments that share the property it depends on.
#
# EACH CANDIDATE IS VALIDATED BY THE LIBRARY'S PRESENCE, NOT BY TRUSTING ITS MECHANISM. That is the
# actual lesson: a resolver that assumes cannot detect the environment where its assumption is false.
#
# SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CANDIDATE. It would have worked here, but it is the SUBMIT
# directory rather than the script's, so submitting from the canonical checkout -- which also contains a
# lib_member_resume.sh -- would silently source the CANONICAL library instead of the frozen one. That
# reintroduces the exact frozen-deployment defect the relative source was written to close, and it does
# so INVISIBLY. A candidate that can resolve to the wrong tree is worse than failing closed.
