### Uncertainties: Step 0 protected the wrong two-thirds, then Step 1 produced a real number

With `56415634` sitting in the queue, the unblocked half of "central value **and** uncertainties" is the
budget. `PLAN-20260806-niter3-budget-and-J28-reroll.md` already had predeclared decision rules, so this
was execution, not a new decision.

**Step 0 — and I got it wrong the first time.** Protect the throw slabs the J28 re-roll consumes; a
`/pscratch` purge turns a two-minute rescale into a re-throw campaign. First pass protected **365 of
542** files and printed "365 readable, 0 unreadable", which reads as complete. The filter was
`"slab" in filename`, and the entire **block** ensemble is named `block5d_flux_17.npz`,
`blockfps_*.npz`, `block4d_0.npz` — no "slab" in the filename, only in the directory.
`rescale_flux_universes.py` rebuilds `C_blocksum` from exactly those, so a purge would have left Step 1
unrunnable while the manifest asserted the inputs were safe. **Filed BEN-032.** What makes it worth a
finding rather than a shrug: the count of what was checked is not the count of what exists, and nothing
inside the result set could reveal the missing third — the denominator had to come from somewhere else
(`find -name '*slab*'` vs `-path '*slab*'` differ by 49%). Found by asking what Step 1 *consumes*, not
by re-reading Step 0.

Corrected: 548 files / 8.1 GiB (542 slabs + 3 bank `flux_univ_ratio.npy` + 3 `cv.npz`), all readable via
`np.load` with every array materialised, every destination file re-hashed, and the copy re-verified
against the **CFS root** — the restore path — not just the source. The check has power: one flipped byte
yields `*** SLAB SET DIVERGED ***`. Excluded deliberately: the banks' 89 GB of per-universe
`sig_*`/`td_*` arrays, which are re-**throw** inputs, not inputs to this rescale. The plan's own "365"
precondition came from the same filter, so it inherited the gap it was written to close.

**Step 1 — the exact re-roll, job `56417324`, ~2 minutes on one CPU node.** Two blockers resolved en
route: ROOT segfaults under the absolute-path interpreter (cling cannot resolve the conda toolchain's
include paths) so it needs `source setup_salloc_env.sh`; and the adopted ensemble had to be *identified*
rather than guessed — `block_slabs_5d` holds 8 files and `block_slabs_5d_sb` holds 36, and re-rolling
the wrong one yields a confidently wrong number. Two independent sources agree on `_sb`.

**The defect was backwards from how it had been framed.** Dividing each universe by `Φ_CV` instead of
its own `Φu` *removes* the normalization spread the flux universes exist to carry, so J28
**understated** the Flux block — by ~4.2× on its sqrt-trace — rather than inflating it. Correcting it
raises the block sum toward a nearly unchanged unified total, which is why the cross term collapses 21%
and `g` falls toward 1.

Both predeclared rules fired, which is the only reason this reads as a result. **Rule 1:** the
first-order "+3–4% upward / ~+6% on the block" estimate is superseded and was **not** confirmed — exact
is +10.19% on the block sum and *down* 0.72% on the unified total. **Rule 2:** the `g` direction is
**convention-dependent** — `mean_shift` grew 22.81%, CV-centering adds `shift²`, so mean-centered
`g_mean` falls 2.55% while CV-centered `g_mean` *rises* 0.62%. "The correction reduces the inflation
factor" is true under one convention and false under the other, and the F7 choice is still open. Rule 3:
`g_max` falling ~23% is one bin out of 10,694 with no interval; `n = 122` throws.

**Adopts nothing.** The quarantine stays in force. And these are the **5-iteration GBDT** slabs, not the
PET lane whose policy moved 2 → 3 — Step 1 was deliberately `niter`-agnostic, so this is complete on its
own terms but does **not** discharge item (d). Landed in all three homes §6 requires plus the plan.
