# KNOWN_ISSUES #13 LATERAL leg (2026-07-14), GPU variant. The bank sweep cannot
# carry the muon/beam bands' SHIFTED background kinematics (sim_background_<axis>_
# <band>_<idx>), so the 9 detector bands (6 muon/beam laterals + 3 GEANT = 18
# universes) + the matched CV re-run through the DIRECT driver, which threads
# --universe into collect_bkg_nd (per-universe background, unfold_nd:662). Reads the
# BKGAWARE omnifile. NON-DESTRUCTIVE outdir uq_5d/universe_sweep_bkgaware (same dir
# the 169 vertical bank-sweep universes land in -> analyze globs the union = 188).
# task 0 = matched CV (no --universe); 1-18 = detector_universes.txt. ~1h, <64GB.

# --- OI-136 / Joseph's ruling 17, 2026-08-22: TWO ROOTS, BOTH MANDATORY, NEITHER DEFAULTED -------
# This line used to read `REPO="<the canonical checkout>"` unconditionally, and every `source`, every
# `cd` and every `python3` below hung off it. That decides the EXECUTING TREE before any interpreter
# or guard starts, so no amount of Python-side work can reach it -- "the wrong root is selected
# before Python or the guard starts" (Joseph, ruling 18).
#   MNV_CODE_ROOT  the approved clean execution tree. Every `.sh` sourced and every `.py` executed or
#                  imported must resolve under it; it is immutable and `git status --porcelain`-empty
#                  for the duration of the run, at a named sha recorded in the run receipt.
#   MNV_DATA_ROOT  the working directory for inputs and products. The canonical checkout is
#                  acceptable in THIS ROLE ONLY. Nothing is executed or imported from it.
# WHY TWO AND NOT ONE: a clean checkout cannot simultaneously host ~47.7 GB of gitignored member
# products and remain clean, and `of_inputs_5d.npz` is absent from a fresh clone, so a clean tree
# cannot serve as the working directory at all.
# NO `${VAR:-<hardcode>}` DEFAULT ANYWHERE: a default is the hardcode wearing a flag, and a silently
# empty defaulted variable makes every path below name a different subject without erroring. Same
# mandatory form, and the same reason, as `pet/sbatch_gate6_leg0_tier_calibration_array.sh:64`.
# The two roots MAY name the same directory; nothing here requires them to differ.
CODE_ROOT="${MNV_CODE_ROOT:?set MNV_CODE_ROOT to the approved clean execution tree -- a checkout at a named sha with git status --porcelain empty. It is NOT the data root.}"
DATA_ROOT="${MNV_DATA_ROOT:?set MNV_DATA_ROOT to the tree holding the inputs for this leg and receiving its products. Nothing is executed or imported from it.}"

# SOURCED RELATIVE TO THIS SCRIPT, NOT THROUGH ${REPO}. A launcher frozen at a sha that sources its
# member-axis library from the MUTABLE canonical checkout is not frozen: at run time it picks up
# whatever is in /pscratch/.../MINERvA-OmniFold, which is on a divergent local main that does not
# contain this library at all. Demonstrated, not theorised -- the cluster probe failed 16/16 with
# exactly that error. Relative sourcing means a frozen deployment sources its OWN frozen library,
# and a git worktree resolves its own. The library lives beside this file, so no path arithmetic.
# The three PRE-EXISTING ${REPO} sources on the lines above have the same exposure across 244
# tracked .sh and are deliberately NOT touched here: that is a repo-wide migration, not a patch.
# --- M(ii) member axis: LOCATE lib_member_resume.sh, then source it -------------------------------
# `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` IS THE SPOOL PATH UNDER sbatch. Slurm copies the batch script to
# /var/spool/slurmd/job<N>/slurm_script and executes the COPY, so `dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}"` is the
# spool directory and the library was never staged there. Measured, not theorised: stage 0's first three
# arrays died in 12 s at exactly this line with
#   /var/spool/slurmd/job57250483/lib_member_resume.sh: No such file or directory
# while the library sat correctly at 13,845 bytes in the frozen tree.
#
# WHY FOUR PROBE RUNS AND A GATE PASSED OVER IT. Direct execution and the argv probe (which `source`s
# launchers from a parent shell) BOTH preserve BASH_SOURCE as the real path. sbatch is the only
# invocation that stages the script, and it is the only one production uses. The go-line was verified
# twice in environments that share the property it depends on.
#
# EACH CANDIDATE IS VALIDATED BY THE LIBRARY'S PRESENCE, NOT BY TRUSTING ITS MECHANISM. That is the
# actual lesson: a resolver that assumes cannot detect the environment where its assumption is false.
#
# SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CANDIDATE. It would have worked here, but it is the SUBMIT
# directory rather than the script's, so submitting from the canonical checkout -- which also contains a
# lib_member_resume.sh -- would silently source the CANONICAL library instead of the frozen one. That
# reintroduces the exact frozen-deployment defect the relative source was written to close, and it does
# so INVISIBLY. A candidate that can resolve to the wrong tree is worse than failing closed.

# from the code root. The resolver above may legitimately pick MNV_LAUNCHER_DIR, `dirname
# $BASH_SOURCE` or `scontrol Command`; this asserts that whichever it picked is
# ${MNV_CODE_ROOT}/nd-unfolding and FAILS CLOSED if it is not. Without it a launcher can be deployed
# in the code root and still source another tree's library with nothing saying so.
#
# IT IS PLACED AFTER THE `source`, NOT BEFORE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE AND DISCLOSED COMPROMISE.
# The resolver block above is extracted VERBATIM and pinned BYTE-IDENTICAL across all eight
# launchers by `tests/test_uq_remediation.py::LibraryResolverSurvivesSbatch`, whose window runs from
# `# --- M(ii) member axis: LOCATE` to this `source` line inclusive. A check inserted INSIDE that
# window would (a) silently change what that test extracts and (b) be executed by it as a fragment
# in which `CODE_ROOT` is not defined -- the same defect shape as an extracted tail losing the
# `set -eo pipefail` above its cut. Measured, not predicted: placing it inside turned three of that
# class's arms red. The residual exposure is therefore any side effect the wrong tree's library has
# AT SOURCE TIME; it defines functions, and nothing downstream of here runs before this exits 2.
